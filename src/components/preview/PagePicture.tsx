/**
 * The picture of a résumé page, as a FILE rather than a render.
 *
 * Every design and every example already ships a lossless page image of its
 * exported PDF (1200px wide, /img/templates/<id>.webp, /img/examples/<slug>.webp).
 * A grid card was mounting a live React résumé instead — the whole template
 * engine, per card, 108 times on /examples. Measured on the production build
 * (2026-09-15, _local/grid-perf.cjs): 10.5s of main-thread task time on a desk
 * and 14.5s on a phone to browse /examples to the bottom, and even after all
 * that only 47 of the 108 cards had a résumé in them — the rest were still the
 * grey sketch, because the idle queue that keeps the scroll smooth can only
 * grant one card at a time and the reader scrolls past faster than it grants.
 *
 * A picture costs a decode. What it cannot do is reflect a document edited a
 * second ago — which none of these three grids ever showed: /templates renders
 * one fixed sample, /examples and the picker render the library's own samples.
 * The pictures are made from those same samples by scripts/make-page-images.cjs,
 * so what a card shows is the page the export produces, not an approximation
 * of it — the live thumbnail was the approximation (it re-ran the fit-to-page
 * search itself, at card size, in at most two passes).
 *
 * The box carries the picture's OWN aspect ratio, from its declared height, so
 * nothing is cropped and nothing shifts as the file lands. The accent sketch
 * stays underneath until the decode finishes: a white gap reads as a card that
 * failed, a sketch reads as one arriving.
 *
 * A GRID card is given the 520px lossy twin, not the 1200px picture (see
 * data/pageThumbs): the big file is the one the lightbox opens, and a card is
 * at most 260 CSS px. Scrolling /examples to the bottom on a phone moved
 * 11.07 MB of pictures while the cards pointed at the big files, and 3.90 MB
 * of the twins buys the same 108 cards. Whichever it is given, the width and
 * height below are that FILE's, so nothing is described as a size it is not.
