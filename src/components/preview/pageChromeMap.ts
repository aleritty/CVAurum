/**
 * Structural (not pixel) mapping from print-mode paginate() cuts onto the
 * corresponding y in the editable canvas — native-multipage-pdf plan, task 5
 * fix round(s). See ResumePreview.tsx's own top comment for WHY this exists:
 * the editable canvas and the print-mode DOM are NOT the same height for
 * identical content (the editable canvas renders real, on-screen inline-
 * editing affordances — delete buttons, "+ Add" rows, per-chip edit controls
 * — that the print-mode DOM never has, confirmed empirically to run 1.5-1.7x
 * taller for ordinary content), so a print-space y cannot be reused directly
 * as an edit-space y.
 *
 * The fix: identify WHICH element (by stable structural identity — section
 * `data-section` key + entry index within that section, never raw position
 * or pixel y) a cut falls between, using ONLY a print-mode blocks array
 * (the SAME data that decided the cut), then look up the EDIT-mode DOM's
 * copy of those same two elements and take the midpoint of THEIR (edit-
 * space) gap.
 *
 * SINGLE-COLUMN callers pass `extractPageBlocks(printRoot)`'s own output
 * (the combined — and, for single-column docs, ONLY — list) with anchors
 * collected from the whole root.
 *
 * TWO-COLUMN callers (fix round 2 — native-multipage-pdf plan, task 5):
 * `extractPageBlocks`'s COMBINED list interleaves main/aside columns via
 * `combineColumns` (paginate.ts) into one merged gap sequence, where a
 * combined gap can straddle two DIFFERENT columns' content — counting its
 * section-gap/entry-gap blocks the way `locateStructural` below does would
 * not reliably name one real section. Pass `extractMainColumnBlocks
 * (printRoot)` (walk.ts) instead — the MAIN column's own, pre-merge block
 * list, in the SAME coordinate space the combined cuts are (both measured
 * from `printRoot`'s own top) — with anchors collected from just the main
 * column element on both sides. The aside is deliberately never consulted:
 * separators are full-width lines, and main is the one column every
 * template always renders. When the main column has already ended before a
 * cut (the cut was really driven by a longer aside), or a cut otherwise
 * can't be attributed to one main-column gap, `mapCutToEditSpace` returns
 * `null` — callers suppress that ONE separator rather than draw an
 * estimated line that risks landing inside text (a missing line beats a
 * wrong line), while the page-count badges (computed independently, from
 * the combined result) are unaffected.
