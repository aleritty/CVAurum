 * Draws a text run's glyph outlines as VECTOR PATHS instead of a real PDF

 *  - DECORATIVE runs (SVG logo monogram marks, CSS `::before`/`::after`/
 *    `::marker` separator/bullet glyphs — `TextRun.isDecorative` in
 *    types.ts): this is the ONLY layer painted for them, so a logo letter
 *    stays pixel-identical without ever entering the extractable text layer
 *    an ATS reads (task-10b brief, defect B — a logo's monogram letter was
 *    showing up mid-sentence in real résumé content, e.g. "EXPERIENCE V
 *    Senior Software Engineer").
 *
 * ONLY decorative runs take this path. Tracked (letter-spaced) and small-caps
 * REAL content used to be drawn here too, as the visible half of a two-layer
 * trick whose other half was an invisible text copy; it is ordinary visible
 * text in a tracked cut of the font now (see `paintTrackedRun`).
 *
 * fontkit (already registered on the document for real-text font embedding)
 * exposes each glyph's outline (`glyph.path`) in FONT units with a y-UP axis
 * (baseline at y=0, ascenders positive — verified empirically against a real
 * embedded .ttf, not assumed). `page.drawSvgPath` expects an SVG-style y-DOWN
 * local space that it flips back to PDF's y-up itself via a `scale(1, -1)`
 * around the given (x, y) anchor (verified by reading pdf-lib's
 * `operations.js`), so `glyphPathToDrawPath` only needs to negate y (and
 * scale) — never flip x — before handing coordinates to drawSvgPath.
 *
 * `xPt` defaults to the run's own (unadjusted) position, which is what every
 * decorative call wants: a mark synthesized by walk.ts is positioned against
 * the element it belongs to, not against the previous run's drawn end.
 *
 * Returns the run's total drawn advance width in CSS px (the same `cursor`
 * accumulation already needed to position every glyph, just handed back
 * instead of discarded) — task 15's decorative-box capture hook in `paintOps`
 * uses this as the "measured advance width" for a decorative run's bounding
 * box, so callers that don't care (the tracked-heading real-content path)
 * simply ignore the return value; computing it is free either way, since the
 * loop below runs regardless of who's listening.

/**
 * Paints a TRACKED (letter-spaced) or SMALL-CAPS real-content run as ORDINARY,

 *
 * What this replaces, and why. `/ActualText` (the PDF spec's own §14.6.2 way
 * of telling an extractor the real string behind unusual glyph positioning) is
 * not read by pdf.js's `getTextContent()` — its evaluator only ever reads
 * `MCID` off a marked-content properties dict — and every extractor in use
 * instead reconstructs words from glyph GEOMETRY: pdf.js splits at any gap
 * over `fontSize * 0.102`, and PyMuPDF and poppler do the equivalent. So a
 * heading drawn with PDF's character-spacing operator (`Tc`) at the 0.03em to
 * 0.2em our templates use extracts as "S U M M A R Y".
 *
 * The old answer was two layers: visible vector glyph outlines carrying the
 * tracking, plus an INVISIBLE (text rendering mode 3) untracked copy of the
 * string underneath for extractors to read. It extracted correctly, and an
 * external ATS scanner read the file and reported "text drawn invisibly" —
 * which is precisely the shape of that trick, whatever its intent. 22 of the
 * 93 text objects in one export were mode 3.
 *
 * The answer now is to make the glyphs honestly that wide: `fonts.embed`'s
 * third argument returns a cut of the face with `letterSpacingPx / sizePx`
 * baked into its `hmtx` advances (fonts.ts's `widenAdvances`). `Tc` stays 0,
 * no gap is inserted BETWEEN glyphs, and the same three extractors read
 * "SUMMARY" as one word — measured, and asserted per-design by
 * _local/gate-hidden-text.cjs.
 *
 * SMALL CAPS leaves the text layer exactly as the source wrote it. The reduced
 * pieces are drawn with their own LOWERCASE text in a small-caps cut of the
 * face (see `trackedPieces`), so a heading the canvas shows as "Sᴜᴍᴍᴀʀʏ" is
 * drawn as capitals and extracts as "Summary" — from one visible operator,
 * with nothing hidden under it. Uppercasing the string instead was the first
 * attempt, and it made the file say something the page does not: a skill-group
 * label set in small capitals went out as LANGUAGES, which a parser reads as a
 * section heading.
 *
 * `Tz` (horizontal scaling) fits the drawn width to the DOM's own measured
 * width exactly as the untracked branch does, and for the same reason: our
 * embedded static fonts measure a run from 0.5% (Inter) to 1.8% (Montserrat)
 * wide of what Chromium renders, so without it the ink drifts right of its
 * on-screen position by the end of a long heading. The DOM width already
 * INCLUDES the tracking (Chromium adds one increment per character, the last
 * included — the same thing `widenAdvances` does), so the numerator and the
 * denominator are the same measurement and the ratio lands near 100. Same
 * 90-110 sanity band as the untracked branch; negative tracking is simply a
 * narrower variant and needs no special case.
 *
 * Returns the natural (pre-`Tz`) advance and the `Tz` actually used, which
 * `paintOps` folds into the shared `prevRealEnd` bookkeeping unchanged.

/**
 * Draws ONE visible space across the empty gap between two runs the browser
 * put on the SAME visual row.
 *
 * The defect, measured on a real export: between two runs with nothing at all
 * between them — what the painter writes between contact items, and between an
 * entry title and its date — PyMuPDF reads two separate LINES, and so do the
 * viewers that group text the way it does, so drag-selecting a contact row
 * jumps from item to item and an extractor emits each item on a line of its
 * own. pdf.js hides this by inventing a space out of the geometry; the others
 * do not. PDF's word-spacing operator (`Tw`) is not the answer: it applies
 * only to the single-byte code 32, and our fonts embed as composite (two-byte
 * codes), so the readers that follow that rule ignore it.
 *
 * A real space glyph, horizontally scaled to exactly the gap, is: it advances
 * the pen by the same amount the void did, draws no ink, and every engine then
 * reads one line.
 *
 * It is bounded by the LINE BOX (walk.ts's `lineBoxId`), never by geometry
 * alone — so a sidebar term that happens to sit level with a main-column
 * bullet can never be joined to it, whatever the gap. And it is never drawn
 * where a space already exists on either side, so no run gains a doubled one.
 *
 * `prev` is the run drawn immediately before, so a row the painter does NOT
 * cross in one stretch is not bridged. A grid that flows down its columns
 * (atlas's header sets `grid-template-rows: repeat(3, auto)` and fills column
 * by column) paints the whole left column, then the whole right one, and its
 * visual rows stay separate lines - which is correct, and the same rule that
 * keeps a sidebar out of the main column: the reading order there really does
 * run down each column, and a row of it is a coincidence of layout. Bridging
 * from the row's own last end was tried and measured: the spaces land, and no
 * engine merges the lines anyway, because the pen had already moved on.

  // our EMBEDDED font's width, plus a safety margin (task 10a, defect 5).
  // That guess drifts in BOTH directions depending on the exact string
  // (confirmed while diagnosing task 10c's TEXT_MISMATCH cases: for one bold
  // label on a "Category: keywords" line, canvas's estimate undershot our
  // embedded font's ACTUAL width, risking touching glyphs; for an adjacent
  // label on the very SAME line, our embedded font actually drew NARROWER
  // than the browser did, leaving a small unintended gap the OTHER
  // direction) — a single fixed-direction margin can't close both at once.
  // Doing it HERE instead, with the font already embedded, replaces the
  // guess with the EXACT metric pdf.js itself measures against
  // (`font.widthOfTextAtSize`), so there is nothing left to estimate.
  //
  // The correction is deliberately SYMMETRIC (see the negative-allowance
  // check below), not "push right only": a boundary meant to be flush (no DOM
  // whitespace between the two elements at all — e.g. a bold "Category"
  // label immediately followed by a ": keywords" span) must land at
  // EXACTLY the previous run's true end regardless of which direction our
  // font's width happens to differ from the browser's, because pdf.js's own
  // word-boundary heuristic (task-10b report) reacts to ANY gap above
  // ~10% of the font size, in EITHER direction, with no notion of
  // "acceptable drift" — only an exact match reliably avoids it.
  //
  // However, negative gaps arise from TWO distinct classes: (1) sub-pixel
  // overlap from Chromium/embedded-font metric drift, and (2) visual-order
  // reversal (CSS flex-direction: row-reverse, rtl, Grid placement) with
  // tens-of-points gaps and short previous runs. Drift is NOT proportional to
  // the previous run alone — it accumulates along the whole CHAIN of runs
  // already snapped together on this baseline, because a snapped run
  // inherits its predecessor's displacement. Measured on the real corpus
  // (Montserrat 400/700 at 9.3pt): a long run drifts 1.76% of its own drawn
  // width vs the embedded metric; a short bold run immediately after it
  // inherits that full drift, so bounding the allowance by the SHORT run's
  // own width (as if each boundary were independent) collapses to one
  // space-width and rejects a legitimate snap. Inter drifts only 0.49% by
  // comparison, so family matters. A chain-proportional allowance fixes
  // this: negAllowancePt = max(spaceWidth, DRIFT_FRACTION * chainWidth),
  // where chainWidth is measured from the START of the current contiguous
  // snapped chain (not just the immediately previous run) to its drawn end.
  // DRIFT_FRACTION = 0.04 gives >2x margin over the worst measured family
  // while reorder offsets (the case the lower bound exists for) stay
  // line-scale on short chains and remain excluded. The positive bound stays
  // one space width (a larger positive gap is DOM-intended spacing).

 * `.rm-footer::after` — one page's worth of the strip's colour hung below

 * 1122.5px tall and begins at y = 1225.1 on a 1150.6px document, i.e. BELOW

 * sections 2-3; the break-point SELECTION itself is paginate.ts's job — this
 * only consumes its `cutsPx` result).
 *
 * `cutsPx` empty (single page — the overwhelming common case) is special-
 * cased to return `[ops]`, literally the SAME array reference with zero
 * per-op cloning — so painting it is byte-for-byte identical to calling
 * `paintOps` directly the way render.tsx always did before this task (the
 * plan's global constraint: single-page docs stay byte-identical).
 *
 * For N > 1 pages: every non-chrome op is assigned to the band containing
 * its own `opBandAnchorPx`, then translated by that page's own offset —
 * `bandTops[pageIndex] - pageTopPaddingPx` for every page after the first,
 * always exactly 0 for page 1 (spec section 3: page 1 renders its band at
 * its natural position; every later page's band is shifted up so its own
 * content starts exactly `pageTopPaddingPx` below that page's top, the same
 * visual margin page 1 already has built into its own natural layout).
 * A `pageChrome` op that is really the document's ground (`isDocumentGround`
 * — tagged AND starting at the document's top) skips band assignment
 * entirely and instead repeats, via `clampChromeOpToPage`, on EVERY page;
 * one that only carries the tag is assigned like any other op.
 *
 * Op order within each page's own list is preserved from `ops`' original
 * document order (a single left-to-right pass appends to whichever page
 * bucket(s) each op belongs to), so later ops still paint on top of earlier
 * ones on the SAME page, exactly like the single-page case already relies on.
 *
 * Task 6b (straddling decoration ops): the top-edge-only rule above is right
 * for text and images — paginate.ts's own break-point rules guarantee a
 * legal cut never falls inside either — but a tall, thin, purely decorative
 * `rect`/`line` op (e.g. timeline's vertical entry rail) can legitimately
 * straddle a cut, and assigning it to a single band the way ordinary content
 * is assigned clips the rest of it off the following page (sweep artifact:
 * 155px of missing rail at the top of page 2). For a NON-pageChrome, RADIUS-
 * FREE `rect`/`line` op (see `hasAnyRadiusOp` — a radiused rect can't crop
 * cleanly at a straight cut, so it's excluded and falls back to single-band
 * below) whose own `[top, bottom]` span intersects MORE THAN ONE band, the
 * op is pushed into EVERY band it intersects, each copy first CROPPED to
 * that band's own `[bandTop, bandBottom)` range (`cropOpToBand` — fix-round-
 * 1, finding I2: an uncropped copy could paint past its own band's boundary
 * into territory the adjacent copy already covers, the same document-space
 * slice painted twice) and then translated by that band's own offset like
 * any other op. An op that only intersects ONE band (the overwhelming common
 * case, including every rect/line on a single-page document) falls through
 * to the exact same anchor-point path every other kind uses, so nothing here
 * changes behavior for non-straddling ops.
