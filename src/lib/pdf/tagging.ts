/**
 * Tagged-PDF structure (2026-08-19 user request: "fully accessible").
 *
 * A tagged PDF carries a STRUCTURE TREE alongside the painted marks: a
 * document outline of headings, paragraphs and lists whose leaves point at
 * the exact pieces of the content stream that draw them. Screen readers use
 * it to announce "heading level 2, Experience" instead of guessing from font
 * sizes, and it is what PDF/UA (and PDF/A level A) require.
 *
 * Two halves live in two places, joined by an MCID (marked-content id):
 *  - the CONTENT STREAM half — `/H2 <</MCID 4>> BDC … EMC` around the drawing
 *    operators, or `/Artifact BDC … EMC` for decoration a reader must skip
 *    (paint.ts);
 *  - the TREE half — StructTreeRoot -> Document -> H1/H2/P/L/LI/Figure
 *    elements, each naming its page and its MCIDs, plus the ParentTree that
 *    lets a reader walk back from a mark to its element (this file).
 *
 * Role derivation is deliberately DOM-driven rather than heuristic: the
 * templates already carry the semantics we need in their class names, so a
 * heading is whatever the résumé renders as a heading, on all 52 templates.
